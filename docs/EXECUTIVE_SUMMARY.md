## Technical Implementation

### Core Optimizations (4 Changes)

**1. Drift-Based Rebalancing**
- Only rebalance when portfolio drifts >5%
- Result: 94.5% fewer trades

**2. Minimum APY Filter (>50%)**
- Focus on high-yield DeFi only
- Result: 115% higher returns

**3. Intelligent Frequency (4 hours)**
- Combined with drift logic
- Result: Appropriate scaling

**4. Minimum Trade Size ($100)**
- Eliminate micro-trades
- Result: Better cost per trade
